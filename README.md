Picamera Workshop
=================

A simple tutorial on how to get going with the Raspberry Pi camera and Python.

This workshop was first run as part of the Digimakers@Bristol events and is available to anyone 
(especially those who attended!) who wants to learn about controlling their picamera with Python.
