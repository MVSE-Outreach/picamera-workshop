    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Hello there! Welcome to the Digimakers @-bristol picamera workshop! By the 
    time you are finished here you'll know all about the Raspberry Pi camera 
    module and how to control it using the <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">
    Python</a> programming
    language. Obviously, a little prior experience with Python is good but never fear, 
    even if you have  never experienced programming or the Raspberry Pi we will soon
    have you up'n at em in no time at all.
    </p>
    <p>The main aim of the workshop is to give you a whistle stop tour of the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5672">picamera 
    python module</a>. This is essentially 
    a nice and easy way of controlling the camera without having to use the 
    <i>raspistill</i> and <i>raspivid</i> programs. This means we can be a lot 
    clevererrerr in what we build!
    </p>

        The first thing you will need to do is to make sure that you have the picamera
        module installed on your Raspberry Pi. Make sure you are in the graphical environment
        for the pi (you might have to type <i>startx</i> when you first log in) and open up
        a terminal window. You can do this by clicking on the <i>LXTerminal</i> icon on your
        desktop.  
    <p>
    If you have never used the camera before the first thing you will need to do is to
    enable it. Type <i>raspiconfig</i> and press the down arrow key until you reach 
    "Enable Camera", press enter and enable the camera.
    <span style="text-align:center;">You only need to do this if you have never used 
    your picamera before!</span>
    </p>
    Once you have done that exit the tool, remembering to reboot the pi so the install can
    finish. When you log back in you can open a terminal window again and type the
    following command to install the library:
    <code>sudo apt-get install python-picamera</code>
    That's it, you are all ready to go! Lets get programming!

    <h2>2. Hello <s>World!</s> PiCamera!</h2>
    <p>
        For this first task we are going to make a very simple program that displays the 
        camera's picture on your Pi for a few seconds and then makes it disappear. The code below
        shows you how to do this. Lazy people can download it 
        <a target="_blank" href="/projects/picam/code/hello_world_cam.py">here</a>.
    </p>
    <code>
        # import the two modules that we will need<br/>
        import time<br/>
        import picamera<br/>
        <br/>
        # create our camera variable. We will be using this A LOT so remember it!<br/>
        cam = picamera.PiCamera()<br/>
        <br/>
        # start displaying the image preview on screen.<br/>
        cam.start_preview()<br/>
        <br/>
        # wait for ten seconds<br/>
        time.sleep(10)<br/>
        <br/>
        # close the preview window<br/>
        cam.stop_preview()<br/>
        <br/>
        # Always make sure you close the connection to your camera!<br/>
        # Otherwise you won't be able to connect to it next time and<br/>
        # you'll have to reboot!<br/>
        cam.close()<br/>
        <br/>
    </code>
    <p>
        If everything is installed and set up correctly you will see a big window fill your
        sceen with a lovely pretty picture of what your camera can see! If not, now would 
        be the time to shout for help!
